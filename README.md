# Alexa Restaurant Finder 
Find the perfect dinner spot, tailored just for you. 

## Description
In a world with so many restaurat choices, it can be difficult, if not impossible, to narrow down your choices. Enter Alexa Restaurant Finder. Simply tell Alexa what kind of cuisine you are feeling and where you are located to get started. Alexa then delegates the work to a Lambda function, which calls the Yelp API behind the scenes. All the heavy lifting is done for you and a list of your top 3 recommended choices are recited back to you. But you don't have to stop there. Continue to filter by distance radius, rating, or parking availability. Finish it off by having Alexa call the restaurant so you can ask for the current time.
